5,I like this book and quality of book is good.,5
2,"The book is an extremely slow and boring read, and rambles on and on about omens, about following your destiny, about ""knowing"" right and wrong, and so on. I didn't really get what the author is trying to convey, nor did I feel that it was a ""motivating"" or a ""feel good"" book.",2
3,"Pleasant read with lot of human sentiments. Story narrated what are distractions and motivations to work for personal legend. Some of the aspects of story are not practical, but carried the underlying message well",3
2,"Start of the story is good but when you reach at end, then i felt it was bit boring",2
3,Decent storybook. More or less like The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari. A bit disappointed that it didn't motivate me in any way.,3
2,Overrated book.. bought it because of so much hupe...but i would say a normal book..nothing much for that exceptional.,2
5,A lovely and perfect book to conquer and learn the ethics of your life !!!,5

5,Such a greatt bookkkkk . So this is my first book and i am beginner i bought this bcz of yt and i totally love it . The story is so great and the language is also easy to understand . I will prefer the alchemist by Paulo Coelho. And this book have alot of life lessons too my highlighter ran out of ink while highlighting the lines of this book . I would totally prefer this book for beginners .,5
5,"As a perplexed soul in this wide open world we often tend to derail from our path and run monotonously towards money, fame etc on societal pressure. This book enlightens te readers mind with the need to explore,experience and listen to our inner callings. Defenitely a best read, especially for younger minds.",5
5,Great book with great lessons about life and it can be change your vision to see your Life goals,5
5,Wonderful no words to describe it . Recommended for everyone first time readers also can read this piece of art author has done great job by creating this masterpiece,5
3,The book was somewhat dry as the protagonist was just simply following the omens without using his own conscience. It could have been better,3
5,This is one of the best book I've ever read. I'll recommend everyone to give it a try. The packaging wasn't really good the corner of the book is smudged. But it was okay,5
5,"Paulo Coelho! The book says that you can lead a normal yet exiting life! You just have to dream, so that you can achieve it! Whatever the dream, you pursue that and you can be the most self-fullfilled man on earth!",5
5,"This is a great book to read for a beginner. Though was engaging to read, as we head towards the end of story I felt certain part could've been to the point. Overall I don't regret reading this as it has some really valuable message. The quality of novelty/pocket edition is excellent.",5
5,"I thought I liked reading books. Usually I would find books interesting and go through them quickly. That was a nice experience, but this is the first book ever that was exciting for me. I've read romance, fiction, sci-fi but nothing excited me as much as this book. Every part is well written, it's a exciting story yet inspiring and so many good teachings to learn from. A definite read for any reader.",5
4,Good to read this alchemy story . Heard the silence of the desert. Journey revealing the mystery of lifes spirit!,4
5,"An absolute classic of Russian literature, this extraordinary piece of art is written in a very easy yet immaculate way. You can read the whole book of around 450 pages in two days; the writing is just that easy to understand. The introduction to this book by Will Self is a great addition. The product quality of Vintage is always the best and delivery and packaging was absolutely fine for me.",5
5,"Six stars ...mind boggling story telling ...Woland, Behemoth, Azazello, Korovyev ...characters to cheer for...a must must read...JK Rowling must have gotten her inspiration from this novel",5
4,"The Master and Margarita is reminiscent of Fyodor Dostoevsky - but more fantastical. This is not necessarily an advantage. The intricate fantasies often confuse the reader and can become wearisome. The first part of the work is gripping and holds the attention with its dizzying pace. As the narrative unfolds, however, BulgakovÕs sense of purpose is diluted and the tale becomes meandering. I finished reading the book dutifully - but as time went on I found myself returning to it with decreasing interest and anticipation. For all that, it is undoubtedly a magnificent achievement of the imagination. It draws the reader into the world of the supernatural - sometimes in an individual and innovative way but sometimes by employing hackneyed folkloric images. I hope that when Bulgakov speaks of witches using flying ointment and riding astride broomsticks he does so with amusement and with tongue in cheek. The Master and Margarita certainly persuades readers who are willing and able to suspend their disbelief that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in conventional philosophies - but the suspension of disbelief requires some effort. It is not surprising that no publishers could be found in the old Soviet Union who were willing to bring this work to the attention of their public.",4
5,"Read it, stick with it if you struggle with where itÕs going at any point. It will take you breath away, make you laugh, and cry.I realised half way through that I was in the unbelievably fortunate position of reading something for the first time that would become part of my life afterwards.",5
5,"Just...just read it. Really. There are no words I could give that could accurately express what this book makes the reader feel. Really, it is an anomaly. But all I guess that that is all I can say without getting into the intricacies of the plot and without revealing things that readers should find out on their own through reading this utterly pleasing, mind opening, bizarre and fantastic book. I cannot believe I hadn't read it sooner. An absolute gem of an underrated classic. I have read it twice and I'm sure as anyone else who has enjoyed this book would agree, twice isn't enough. If this book is on your list, buy it. Even if you do not personally like a lot of aspects in regards to the story, reading it cover to cover will never be a regret. One of the all time underrated greats.",5
5,"In ÒThe Master and Margarita,"" Mikhail Bulgakov crafted one of the great novels of the 20th century. ThereÕs no easy way to describe this book which touches on the Soviet literary scene in the 1930s, religion, the devil and his court, beautiful women, Pontius Pilate, Jesus, theater, StalinÕs regime and a host of other subjects. Add in memorable characters, from a unique take on the devil to his wise cracking cat to a writer in an insane asylum and his lover, and you have a memorable book with insightful takes on love, history, art and religion. Despite the important topics covered in the book, Bulgakov offers enough irony and humor to produce one of the funniest novels I have come across in some time. Most English translations are very solid, perhaps a result of the book being first published in the 1960s, three decades after it was first written. This is easily one of the greatest novels I ever had the pleasure and honor of reading. Highest recommendation.",5
1,"I liked the first chapter, and I thought I was going to like this. But then the two characters are hardly seen for the next 200 pages or so and what we get is an introduction to many characters, flitting from one situation to another in a rapid manner. There are so many characters with no plot of character development. In terms of style of reminded me of a hundred years in solitude (another book I did not enjoy) and there can be no doubt that Garcia was influenced by this. The second half of the book, introducing the master and Margarita was better for me, but the dark fairy tale just wasn't for me. Overall, I found this a frustrating read.",1
2,I don't mind a bit of magical realisim and absurdity but this was too much for me. The talking cat was amusing to start with but the numerous crazy scenes felt meaningless and tedious to read through.,2
5,"I cannot even begin to emphasize how this book is a literary gem. Bulgakov, using his brilliant skills, has managed to take the reader to another era, with bizarre characters through his detailed and rich literary artistry. This book has allowed me to recognize Mikhail Bulgakov as, in my opinion, the best fictional writer of our time. Once again simply said, this is a masterpiece highly recommended to everyone.",5
3,"The product itself is really nice and well made, but the story is quite a different experience. While I enjoyed the first part of the book the second part proved to be quite boring. Even so, the idea is very interesting and it's an important presentation of the communist regime and suprarealism.",3
4,"I really enjoyed this wacky but incredibly smart book. I was recommended to read it and I'm glad I did,never read a book quite like it. Its creepy yet with moments of humor. A underrated masterpiece.",4
4,"The translation could be better. It was vague in some places. I definitely recommend this book to everyone. Now, I need to read more about this book to digest it better.",4
5,I'm not sure how I've managed to miss this surreal satirical masterpiece until now - but many thanks to Nick from the Station book group for choosing it. How did he get books and plays like this past Pravda and the other apparatus of state censorship? It's interesting to contrast Bulgakov's and Shostakovich's experiences of struggling to survive and work under Stalin.,5
5,"I liked the book very much, I am a great fan of Russian literature, the characters are rich and lush but after reading half way the story is not clever or imaginative but completely bonkers!",5
5,Love this book .One of my all time favourites and always on my bookshelf,5
5,"An extraordinary read. I was skeptical at first, but as I continued to read I found myself mesmerized. Bulgakov is a storyteller in the mold of Gabriel Garcia Marquez. He blends wit and humor with a deep exploration of artistic, philosophical, and historical themes. This is truly a one-of-a-kind novel.",5
4,"Magnificent in scale and very creative. The writing is excellent, but the plot is a bit confused.",4
4,Just wonderfully mental! I'm sure there is lots of analysis in other reviews that are far more eloquent than I could hope to be but this book was just fabulously weird.,4
5,"Any lover of Russian literature must read this book. I was entranced from beginning to end. At one moment seemingly factual and then another, utterly confusing and disturbing. Meet Christ and the devil in one book.",5
5,"Brilliant... if you like Alice in wonderland, and dark comedy. Clever, funny, and unique. Penelope Lively said she couldn't finish it - I could hardly put it down.",5
5,"This is a brilliant book. It is funny, sad, intelligent, ultimately uplifting and humane, and has a lot to say about both Stalin's and Putin's Russia. If you are thinking of reading this, just do it.",5
1,This book is tedious boring and incoherent. A story without purpose reason narrative or interest. Avoids at all costs. It has wasted my time.,1
3,I read this book on the recommendtion of my brother who was very impressed with it. I don't think I quite got the plot!.Sometime in the future I will reread it. I hope things might become clearer to me then.,3
1,"My Russian husband bought this book for me because he had researched and decided this was the best translation. While this may be the case (I don't know about that), the typos in this book are ridiculous! It is literally hard to get beyond the first chapter because of them. Excerpt complete with typos as seen in the book: ""As to his teeth, he haid platinum crowns on his left side and gold ones on his tight. [...] Right eye black, left ieye for some reason green."" I admit that I am particularly sensitive to this kind of thing, and I understand one or two errors getting by an editor, but this book is riddled with them and it makes it difficult to read, at least for me since every typo is like a hiccup in the flow of a sentence.",1
5,The greatest novel written in the 20th Century.,5
5,This is one of the most beautiful books I have read in a long time. The phrases used at different times just caught me offguard in the beauty of their meaning. It was truly an experience and I know the author feels deeply about things and felt a kinship to her. I am going to read more books of this very talented writer. Thank you!,5
4,Nice quick read. No surprises. If you like Adichie's writing this one meets expectations.,4
5,Raw Mind blowing The writing style is flawless and the display of raw emotions is just…,5
4,The emotions & easy language & style were engaging-also liked the way the characters were developed- wish it were longer,4
4,"The book is really nice and deep. The character development is also good but the story is so dense, it would have been better if it was stretched a little longer. Good short story but leaves a little unsatisfied feeling. Look forward to more works of the author.",4
5,"Though the overall story is beautiful and how you can feel everything with the author, there are a few lines that you want to read repeatedly for they are so true and beautiful.",5
3,Okayish I didn't get what the author was trying to convey with this short story. Felt it was incomplete or this was how it was meant to be..blah,3
5,"Artful Sensitive, human and raw. It's a short read, but I couldn't put it down anyway. I",5
5,"Although this book was just 34 pages long, it had a deep impact on my mind",5
4,"The book brings up a very uncomfortable feeling. It ends with no closure. No sort of end. It just stops. Its very well written but if you're like me and prefer an ending whether happy or sad, then this book may disappoint.",4
3,The author did not really justify the story. It was a strange narration. Lots of loopholes in the the plot.,3
4,Author's words make the reader travel through a rollercoaster of emotions. Emotions subtly portrayed but soundly felt. Words can't say some things that are better not said.,4
5,"Brilliantly written! Heart-touchingly good. A must read for everyone. Even though your life is different from that of the protagonist, you can definitely relate to it in some way or the other.",5
5,"As expected, she presents yet another beautifully written piece.",5
5,This is a delightful novella,5
5,"Beautifully evocative, and crisply told.",5
5,"such a joy to read, wish it was longer.",5
5,"This book was AMAZING!!! I love her command of english. Complex but easy enough to read and not burdened by unnecessary grammar. This book made me want to go dig up all my old Chimamda books and re-read them. It was that good. She has such a way with words that draw you completely into the story. My only complaint was that is was too short. Chimamanda, we want more.",5
4,"This was a solid, quick read about a woman by the name of Zikora going through her first birthing experience as a mother. Quick read with good details without being horribly gory.",4
3,"I don’t usually read short stories, but was not expecting it to be just left in limbo. I felt that the end was just cut off, not that I was expecting everything to be resolved, but it just felt unfinished.",3
1,Very disappointing with no substance. In sharp contrast with her last novel which I loved.,1
1,A huge disappointment,1
5,"Brilliantly written! Heart-touchingly good. A must read for everyone. Even though your life is different from that of the protagonist, you can definitely relate to it in some way or the other.",5
5,"This story touched me in a profound way. This amazing writer leaves us wanting more while accomplishing a Goldilocks level of ""just right"". Thank you. Absolutely beautiful.",5
5,I understand that this was a short story but it could have easily been a novel. Some of the language was a little blunt for my taste but overall it was beautifully written. Very engrossing. A good character study.,5
3,I had read half of the book. The writing & language of the book is easy & intersting. The page quality of book which I had purchased is not that good. Seems like that the saller had a got photocopy of original book and the pages r like the rough copy pages.,3
5,Good read,5
5,I loved the book in its simple narrative to explain the deepest meaning of Meaning,5
5,This book I’ve read during a bad phase of my life must read,5
5,A heart touching book.How the author maintained his courage and mental balance in extreme adverse situations in life.A must read book to learn Positivity in Life.,5
5,"Man's Search for Meaning written by Viktor Frankl recounts his experiences as a prisoner in Nazi concentration camps during World War 2. This book is an inspiration to anyone who is facing a Quarter-life or Midlife crisis. Once you read the book,you will feel grateful to everything you have in your life and will try to make it even more worth living. It gives motivation to avoid making a wrong choice, by thinking about the plausible consequences of what we are about to do. Many snippets of wisdom in this short volume!",5
2,"Printing and pages are of bad quality, printing will erase in few days",2
5,"This book is my teacher,motivator, inspiration and soo much more. Must go for this, you can skip the psychological preaching parts of the writer, but cover the full story. It will show and prove you that a human being is capable of bearing,sustaining and coping up of any adverse to worst circumstances of life. After reading this you will feel that your life problems are just so small and they can't stop you from achieving your results, because you are too strong to handle them.",5
5,A pure masterclass. A book everyone on earth should read. Brilliant and just blown away. For sure will make a human much more humble after reading it.,5
5,Breathtaking...an unbelievable story of survival,5
3,"Average read - I bought this book after reading a lot of very positive reviews. But for me it turned out to be not so great read. While the part the author covers during his stay in concentration camp is captivating and gives you the sense of what it takes for a man to survive, the second part of the book is all about logotherapy. This is the part for someone looking for understanding on various psychological therapies. I am not the one looking for it and totally skipped it. So if someone is looking for a light reading material that covers real life stories throughout interspersed with life lessons, this may not be the book for you.",3
3,Overhyped book. Purchased after reading reviews. Personally felt thet the the whole book can be explained in one paragraph also.... meaning of life...,3
5,This is a great book to make you understand that to leave a happy life always find a reason of achievements in your sufferings instead blaming your luck or anybody else.,5
5,It is a really nice book you are going to love it,5
3,"I have heard a lot about this book, I might have expected a lot or may be I have failed to recognise what others have seen or got from this book, given the circumstances how the author has survived is truly commendable but from books perspective little Disappointed..the print of letters is also too small, go for other publisher",3
5,Amazing book if you are feeling lost in life and shows the perspective of Holocaust survivors but how to deal with life.,5
5,Awesome read. I makes us understand that being mentally strong is equally or more important that physical strength .,5
5,Amazing book. It truly Opens your eyes.,5
3,"This book is not a good read if you are beginning reading. Its too deep for starting, every line in this book will contain a meaning, and it might make you lose interest because of the tough vocabulary it has at times, but overall a good read and learning if you already are a reader.",3
5,An amazing book about how the mind can be influenced to make the best out of all situations. Part#1 describes how the author and his mates survived the concentration camps in Auschwitz.,5
3,As always book was deliverd in two days .However somewhat dissapointed by the quality of the book.,3
4,First half if the book is a drag but the second half delivers a powerful message where he expands upon his psychiatric concept of logotherapy. Language could have been simpler.,4
3,"Good ideas,but far stretched sometimes. Worth reading at least once. But there's nothing new in his logotherapy,it is unconsciously done by everyone since ages. Should have elaborated his experiences in concentration camp more.",3
5,One of the best book I ever read... Just fantastically written by the author.,5
5,"One of those books that will change the way you look at Life...It has become so powerful bcoz its been written by someone who's gone through the worst and also by a person who is the best to reflect upon it i.e, a psychiatrist. It is a beautiful coincidence of fate..Must read for every human being on this planet..",5
2,"Sapiens' is a short telling of the entire human history, from pre-anatomically modern humans through the agricultural and scientific revolutions and to the present. Or so it attempts to be. Unfortunately, this enormous task is the book's own undoing. There is no room for any indepth discussions about the various complex issues, and no room to discuss the evidence. The book is filled with assertion after assertion, and virtually nothing to back them up. I looked in the reference section and I was shocked to see how few citations there were. Such a massive subject derserves ten times more citations. If you think you're getting a good scientific description of the facts, don't buy this book. This book is essentially his opinions, and not much else. Any person who has strong knowledge within any of the subjects in the book will quickly realise that Harari is not an expert on much of what he writes about. He does not just make many claims. He makes many wrong claims. And many, many more misleading ones. It's one of those books that are popular with the layman, but not so much with the expert. When he leaves the topic of evolutionary biology, premodern history, and starts talking about modern history the book gets slighter better. Or is that just because I'm not as well-versed in those topics? Do I just not see his errors there, just like a layperson would not see his errors in his account of evolutionary biology, intelligence research, and more? I won't know. The problem is I can't put much trust in him, because there are so many things wrong or misleading stuff elsewhere. And he doesn't provide sufficient evidence.Even in the better parts of the book, it is ultimately somewhat dull. Not much new to learn for me, unfortunately. There are so many books about humans, many of them much better than this. I wouldn't claim that this is the worst book ever, obviously. But to say that it is overhyped is to put it mildly. If you want to read a story, then perhaps you might find it interesting. If you want a factual account that is supported by an honest look at the available evidence, then go somewhere else.",2
1,"If you are a believer, this book is a total waste of time. It is not at all a history of humankind, as it follows the scientific route. Yet to find scientists who can provide something which, when they are dating something, confirms without any shadow of a doubt that it was there at the beginning!",1
1,"If you want to learn about the author's feelings and musings about modern society cloaked in the history of our species, this book is for you. If, however, you, as I did, want to learn something scientific about the progress of our species unspoiled by a political screed, search for something else. Rarely have I felt that I misspent money on a book. In this case, I did. Too bad because it might have been an interesting read. I could go on, but it's not worth more of my time.",1
1,"Of course when you're reading a book, you know the author's views & opinions will be biased, but when you're reading a book, the last thing you want is to be bombarded with strong opinions all the time, subtle hints here and there are good. I mean, you wrote a book about it, so I think people have a pretty good idea on where you stand, but the author smacks it in your face, and that ruined the book, which is a shame because it had the potential to be a great book, don't get me wrong, this was a good book, but not a great one.",1
5,"Very fascinating book. A must read, must have book at every household. After a long time, I have finally found time and completed a book. What next, Yes.. Homo Deus.",5
4,"Nice book to read, you can know about the human history how everything start how thinks change the whole human history .",4
4,A book lover should study this book.,4
4,You can find a details logical and scientific analysis of fact known to us. An eye opener for all the myth frisking around,4
5,An absolute eye opener. Took my time to complete it and enjoyed the whole journey. The book engulfs you and intrigues you and make you want to have more.,5
5,You may find good criticism for this book in reviews and online.. about being too opinionated. That is true too .. but all that is little and beyond that this have so much information and details that it deserves a five star ..,5
4,"The Original book was written way back in 2011 and after English translation it's spreading all over the world! For understanding History of Humans on earth, this is the book! Grab it, read it.",4
5,This book is a must read for all who are intrigued by the remarkable success of homosapiens. Truly enlightening for the average reader and a must read for those who think of themselves as intellectuals.,5
3,"This could have been a consistently engaging read because it's written in clear, simple language and certainly contends with grand ideas but the gaps in data and analyses left my curiosity stranded and re-purposed to poking holes in the arguments for the most part instead of propelling it.",3
4,It's not just a history book but also a work of philosophy. I am not giving 5 stars because I believe the author could have done better with respect to Indian history and society but still it's an exemplary work,4
1,"I have no complaint with Amazon. However, the book is badly written. It appears that the author was himself confused as how to put across his thoughts. On the whole it is a boring book.",1
5,"Must read to get a social, biological and anthropological perspective of humans.It will leave you with more questions than answers but again to find the solutions,the least we have to do is to know the problems first.Must read!",5
5,"A Beautiful narration of our past, present and a bit of future. I really loved the short stories in between such as the story of khusim, gilgamesh, the story of the practice before moon landing and what the natives had to say to Neil Armstrong. Looking forward to read homo deus.",5
5,This book gives some powerful ideas and gives different perspectives regarding evolution of humans right from big bang to creating artificial humans. I would say its a must read book aleast once in life.,5
5,One of the most thought provoking book I have read in recent times. A big thanks and kudos to Yuval Noah harari for this wonderful book.,5
4,The book is awesome. Came in good quality and on time. I just wonder why amazon has stopped giving book marks with the books.,4
4,"Simply one of the best books I have ever read, going down on my all time favourites and wouldn’t mind reading it again",4
5,The author is somewhat biased and some of the theories discussed are subject to verification. But an excellent literary piece of work.,5
5,"Well written. The best part is how the author has blended the political history of the species with its biological, scientific and economic advances. Most fascinating of all how the author has shown that our ability to believe and execute based on narratives of collective imagination sets us apart from our less imaginative ancestors. System of money, companies, capitalism, law, nations, communism and even religion are nothing but theories that we collectively believe in.",5
5,A beautiful rollercoaster of anthropology. Marvelous presentation. The ethical thinking of the author is well depicted from the very fist to last word. A better work to understand our origin and existence.,5
5,"Sapiens is a masterpiece written by Yuval Noah Harari. You can find thousands of books about the evolution of sapiens in the library but there will nothing be quite like this book. It takes you on this journey to the ancient ages when apes and humans were sort of living together. It tells you all the details about that time period and how the sapiens came to be and how they were able to survive when the others did not. It is not just a book, it is an extraordinary piece of history. Just read it.",5
5,This book was so helpful.READ THIS NOW!,5

1,"There’s nothing new here. If you can walk and chew gum at the same time, you don’t need this book.",1
4,"This was fantastic. As for the content, I thought it was great. I’m sure that if I let these tips sink in and utilize them, they will make a difference in my life.",4
4,"A very practical guide about cultivating good habits. Easy to read, easier to understand. This book gives very practical advice on how to develop good habits and let go of bad ones doing simple and small actions.",4
1,"I do not find this book any helpful or eye-opening. The author has put quite an effort throughout the book to drive readers to his website for ""further self-help"" instead of laying out all information in the book. I find it so irritating to mentioning his website all the time like commercial.",1
5,"Simply brilliant! I will for sure come back to it very often, it contains so many clear and straightforward strategies on how to adopt positive habits and get rid of bad ones.",5
2,I read it because I was curious about why Audible was always recommending it to me. It was fine. The advice wasn't bad or anything.,2
5,"There are a lot of books on habits, but this is the best book on habits I've ever read! It breaks things down in a way that is based on research and actionable.",5
5,A practical and highly applicable read.,5
5,Atomic Habits is a useful book. It’s a practical guide to identifying and changing your habits. It’s something you can actually put into practice in your life.,5
5,"This booked helped me create better habits and more importantly, explained how to stick to them. James Clear has helpful tools to break bad habits, create new ones, and explains how tiny changes can lead to big results.",5
5,ONE OF THE BEST IF NOT THE BEST!!! Atomic Habits is one of the best self help book its tells you about how a tiny things in one's life and bring changes in a long  run .,5
5,"Amazing book. Easy to read, fun, very relatable. Atomic Habits will give you many great examples and many different real life concepts that could save up your time.",5

3,"I’m kind of disappointed about how this book turned out, I was really excited to read it.",3
1,"This is an incredibly exasperating tome.  The points are beyond obvious, and it felt like I was reading some self-help book written in the 50s.",1
5,I think this is a great work made after lot of observations... Good book for one who wish to bring changes in themselves..,5
5,Nice book. Been reading it lately and it has so many nice information about habits and how they’re formed.,5
5,Atomic Habits is a powerful book that has changed the way I think about how I live and lead.,5

5,"Think and Grow Rich, in my opinion, is a one of a kind book, and offers readers a completely new paradigm for achieving one's life desires, whatever they may be.",5
4,Probably the first ever book which actually makes sense about plans and their fulfillments.,4
3,"There are some valuable things to pick up from this book but it definitely tested my patience, it's so repetitive and annoying and philosophical and abstract.",3
2,"I was recommended to read ""Think and Grow Rich"" from my life coach and found it to be a decent read. I will be honest though and say that although I found some helpful nuggets along the way, I didn't love the book",2
4,"Unexpectedly, the book impacted me. Greatly. I started reading it as a very confused person, but now I have defined goals for my career and personal life.",4
3,Overall it wasn't bad But I just needed more or perhaps the book was pretty good for its time and I'm just being too critical here,3
5,This was the first and my favorite self-help book I ever have read.,5
1,This book is a piece of crap!I am ambitious and I have an insatiable hunger for growth but this book couldn't make them feel more in anyway.,1
2,"The book gets pretty boring and repetitive, not to mention the unrealistic advices because we have to face it it’s just a commercial book to sell and make money.",2
5,This is one of my Top 5 favorite books of all time. I've read it 3 or 4 times.,5
1,"So many other books can inspire entrepreneurs without the nonsense in this work. I suggest reading something else, maybe Seth Godin or Michael Gerber.",1
1,Some of the thoughts are interesting but are coated in so much crap that it is easy to clean them for use.,1
4,Incredible book. It makes you question everything you though you knew about yourslef and gives you the tools to improve,4
4,This book is so simply to understand. It gives you the mindset to do whatever you want in life. Just read it. It’s amazing.,4
5,This book alone changed little thing about me and my thought process. Take time to think about that sentence. It literally changed my whole way of life. That is how good this book is!,5
5,I have learned a lot from it and now i look at my ambitions differently.,5
5,A real must read. There's a reason it's been read by almost every successful person.,5
5,"This book is amazing. I have been fed so many perspectives, and my own has changed. It is an eye opener. I recommend this to any and everybody.",5
5,One the greatest books ever even after almost 70 yearsWould definitely recommend it,5
5,"The Novel To kill A Mockingbird  Which is Written By Harper Lee and published July 11, 1960 is one of the best book that I read .",5
5,"It is one of the best books that I read. Initially, when I was reading this novel, I did not like this novel.  But as soon as I read it, I started getting interested in this novel.",5
1,This book is not good. I do not understand how people could possibly like it. It is boring from every angle.,1
2,"I found this book incredibly boring. In the first half of the book absolutely nothing happened, yes you found out a bit about the main characters but even they were dull",2
4,"The book starts slowly, but eventually becomes engaging and enjoyable. Many life lessons can be learned through the wisdom in many of theses characters talking.",4
5,"""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is a great novel and the best one to start with.",5
1,"We are reading in English class, and compared to every other book this has to be the worst book I have read in my entire short life. Not very interesting.",1
4,"This book has so many things to learn from. It make you laugh, make you angry, make you smile and finally will make you weep with a smile. A must read novel, I'd say.",4
5,"The book called To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee, in my opinion, is a very inspirational, motivational, enjoyable, and interesting book to read.",5
4,It is very interesting and educational novel . The first half of this novel is not so much interesting but after this boring part you can learn many things,4
5,The story is great and a very marvellous work is done by the author Harper Lee in which she tried her best to explain differences between good and evil,5
4,This book has a very profound meaning that still manages to compel us to ponder over injustices around us and this is what makes it so unique.,4
5,Best book I can grab onto during this lockdown period. I must say this is a piece of art in the very way it has been written.,5
4,It is one of the best books written and must be read in a life time.,4
5,"A classic novel, really a good read , it depicts the society's attitude towards colored people.",5
5,To Kill a Mockingbird is a timeless classic that explores ideas of racial prejudice and small town identity. The characterisation of the children Jem and Scout Finch is outstandingly crafted.,5
3,"It's a good read, a humorous account of a little girl in America and her time in a little town. Although the characters were well-narrated, it isn't gripping, it's rather dull and pale",3
2,This book has good morals and themes but it's so boring and is wayyyy too long compared to 3-minute songs that convey the exact same ideas,2
4,This book make a environment for your feelings to stay everywhere persistent as you are now working on your goal.,4
1,"From being boring, to being racist, to not making sense.....cheers to the others drinking straight acitone from reading this book.",1
5,"An amazing and unique presentation of morals and day to day lessons needed to get through life with ease. The book not only shows the tough, deep and harsh realities but also to come through them and be a better version of oneself.",5
5,"The book is raw and realistic, it sticks to its theme of youth and innocence and doesn't  stray away in order to give better understanding of the case",5
4,I just love this book and I'd read it many more times... Harper lee sure is one of the best authors,4
5,Wow what a well written book. Based on a true story of what happened particularly about racism in America especially towards black people.,5
1,This story overall is a disaster. Everything about the story needs a lot of improvement. The editing is over brutal I don’t know if the editor was legally blind or he had his head up his behind.,1
4,There are some good excerpts in this book. Ofcourse I don’t really agree with all of what he has written but overall a good book to ponder over things.,4
4,"I don’t know what is so great about this book, but it’s good. For the longest time, I was avoiding it thinking it to be another ‘self help’ book.",4
1,The book is hypocritical and lacks any depth. Some sections are repetitive. It feels like a book written to stroke the author's ego.,1
3,"Do Epic Shit consolidates most facets of self-help in a clear, easy language. While it does not exactly have actionable pieces of advice, it does provide his own experiences for case studies.",3
2,"Not a book, but a pamphlet in a very big font. Populated by self evident cliches and truisms.",2
5,One of the best books I have read about someone's life which I kind of relate to.,5
2,Nothing more than a collection of motivational quotes. Good for someone who has never read a self-help book before.,2
4,I loved the simplicity and the clarity of the author. A book which the young as well as the old can easily read and connect. Can be read multiple times as it is inspiring.,4
5,"For me it is not a book it is occen of knowledge about Time,  money.... Everything which I get now.",5
3,"Short book, I listened via audible. I liked many parts of the book, but I also feel the book was a collection of quotes or ideas from other books I’ve read",3
5,This is one of the simplest book I have come across from Indian audience point of view. The thoughts we are brought up have been disrupted and made us think of ourself from a second person’s viewpoint,5
4,This book has a way to get to you. It uses simple and easy to follow language. I would recommend a slow read and sink in. Take in all the lessons and relate with the book with what it's trying to convey,4
2,This book seemed like a collection of tweets or anecdotes with no common theme binding them together. Felt like I was reading a dictionary.,2
4,Pretty good book with vital knowledge and awareness.,4
5,"The book is really very amazing. I'm a student, it helps me to make the right choices in my life. It teaches me to value time, money, family and everything I have",5
2,"It's an assorted collection of the author's ""shower thoughts"" that are loosely grouped into a handful of categories which make up the chapters.",2
4,"This book gives a lot of insight and knowledge into life lessons, understanding how things work and a guide on proper priorities from the author's view. A good read.",4
5,Nicely Written. Amazing facts given by the author. Kudos to him,5
4,Highly Recommended for beginners who haven't touched any self help books in the past and also don't like reading books!,4
5,I liked the book very much. The kind of thoughts ankur have shared is invaluable because it is not some sugar coated content with a fancy title with great cover.,5
4,"It is important to keep your fundamental beliefs and values in mind. It helps you remember why you're doing what you're doing, and it also helps reduce stress and boost motivation.",4
4,Quick easy read and an amazing one I must say . It's definitely not a book where you will learn something new instead a book that makes you realize what you can do and are capable of.,4
4,It's an excellent book. Highlights and sums up the essence of all important aspects of life.,4
5,Loved the format of the book. You can literally open any page and it will make sense .,5
4,Practical nuggets of wisdom across different facets of life. Insightful book,4
5,What a fantastic book. I can see why everyone from Bill Gates to Barack Obama was raving about it.,5

5,An excellent foundation to stimulate an interest and to go on and explore different aspects of anthropology. It was bought for me by my Son.  He told me that Bill Gates ranked this book in his top 10 best reads. I would rank it in my top 3!,5
5,"This is one of the most well written, engaging and information dense books I have ever read.",5
5,"The book is truly exceptional. The author has covered almost all aspects of human history like biology, theism, beliefs, capitalism, nationalism etc",5

5,Absolutely fantastic book.  A big thank you to professor Harari   Full of insights and important information from start to finish.,5
5,"Beginner's guide to sociobiology. And since I am a complete beginner, perfect for me.",5
3,Nothing new! Everything I read in this book to some extent I learned at the anthropology courses taught by academician Balaceanu-Stolnici.,3
5,"Fantastic. Absolutely sublime. I don't think I've ever read a book with such grand scope, or a book that promises to cover so much and actually delivers.",5
5,"This is one of those rare books which is superbly written, intelligent and mind-altering. I am convinced by this author's arguments and my view of the human condition has changed permanently.",5
2,If you have an academic background in linguistics / cognitive science / anthropology / sociology: don't waste your time reading this book.,2
4,"This is a hugely ambitious book; it takes a very broad approach, condensing huge topics into short chapters in an attempt to provide a basis for the development of our entire species.",4
5,I recommend this book to anyone who is curious about why everything is in the way they are today. It helped to improve my world view drastically.,5
4,One of the best books I've come through. Harari has compiled our history and the history of our world in a neat and orderly manner.,4
4,It's really a masterpiece and a feat by Noah. He has put together all history of human kind in a less than 500 pages book.,4
3,"Sapiens is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. It helped my think about why I believe what I do, and deconstruct.",3
1,It feels like one big virtue signal to how primitive ancient people were compared to how contemporary people live now.,1
5,Congratulations to Yuval Novah Harai for his book Sapiens and Thanks to bring us with a breathtaking journey of human history.,5
2,"Sapiens presented some good ideas. Unfortunately, the stream of ideas are often flawed with facts that are untrue. That really gets me. Don’t state a lie to sell a book.",2
4,The book is only excellent if you want to know how humankind began it's journey.,4
3,"Very interesting read, but for all the author’s criticisims, Sapiens is by as far as from the earth to the Sun the most successful creature nature has ever created.",3
4,"Great book overall, but as a christian there are certain parts I found offensive to my beliefs.",4
5,"This is an excellent book about the history of humans, covering all aspects; evolution, anthropology, geography, psychology, religion, ideologies, and the future of humans.",5

2,A self help book should be succinct and not have hundreds of pages with a boring story. Unfortunately this book does the latter.,2
