7,5,I like this book and quality of book is good.,positive
8,2,"The book is an extremely slow and boring read, and rambles on and on about omens, about following your destiny, about ""knowing"" right and wrong, and so on. I didn't really get what the author is trying to convey, nor did I feel that it was a ""motivating"" or a ""feel good"" book.",negative
9,3,"Pleasant read with lot of human sentiments. Story narrated what are distractions and motivations to work for personal legend. Some of the aspects of story are not practical, but carried the underlying message well",neutral
10,2,"Start of the story is good but when you reach at end, then i felt it was bit boring",negative
11,3,Decent storybook. More or less like The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari. A bit disappointed that it didn't motivate me in any way.,neutral

I would totally prefer this book for beginners .,positive
16,5,"As a perplexed soul in this wide open world we often tend to derail from our path and run monotonously towards money, fame etc on societal pressure. This book enlightens te readers mind with the need to explore,experience and listen to our inner callings. Defenitely a best read, especially for younger minds.",positive
17,5,Great book with great lessons about life and it can be change your vision to see your Life goals,positive
18,5,Wonderful no words to describe it . Recommended for everyone first time readers also can read this piece of art author has done great job by creating this masterpiece,positive
19,3,The book was somewhat dry as the protagonist was just simply following the omens without using his own conscience. It could have been better,neutral
20,5,This is one of the best book I've ever read. I'll recommend everyone to give it a try. The packaging wasn't really good the corner of the book is smudged. But it was okay,positive
21,5,"Paulo Coelho! The book says that you can lead a normal yet exiting life! You just have to dream, so that you can achieve it! Whatever the dream, you pursue that and you can be the most self-fullfilled man on earth!",positive
22,5,"This is a great book to read for a beginner. Though was engaging to read, as we head towards the end of story I felt certain part could've been to the point. Overall I don't regret reading this as it has some really valuable message. The quality of novelty/pocket edition is excellent.",positive
23,5,"I thought I liked reading books. Usually I would find books interesting and go through them quickly. That was a nice experience, but this is the first book ever that was exciting for me. I've read romance, fiction, sci-fi but nothing excited me as much as this book. Every part is well written, it's a exciting story yet inspiring and so many good teachings to learn from. A definite read for any reader.",positive
24,4,Good to read this alchemy story . Heard the silence of the desert. Journey revealing the mystery of lifes spirit!,positive
25,5,"An absolute classic of Russian literature, this extraordinary piece of art is written in a very easy yet immaculate way. You can read the whole book of around 450 pages in two days; the writing is just that easy to understand. The introduction to this book by Will Self is a great addition. The product quality of Vintage is always the best and delivery and packaging was absolutely fine for me.",positive
26,5,"Six stars ...mind boggling story telling ...Woland, Behemoth, Azazello, Korovyev ...characters to cheer for...a must must read...JK Rowling must have gotten her inspiration from this novel",positive
27,4,"The Master and Margarita is reminiscent of Fyodor Dostoevsky - but more fantastical. This is not necessarily an advantage. The intricate fantasies often confuse the reader and can become wearisome. The first part of the work is gripping and holds the attention with its dizzying pace. As the narrative unfolds, however, BulgakovÃ•s sense of purpose is diluted and the tale becomes meandering. I finished reading the book dutifully - but as time went on I found myself returning to it with decreasing interest and anticipation. For all that, it is undoubtedly a magnificent achievement of the imagination. It draws the reader into the world of the supernatural - sometimes in an individual and innovative way but sometimes by employing hackneyed folkloric images. I hope that when Bulgakov speaks of witches using flying ointment and riding astride broomsticks he does so with amusement and with tongue in cheek. The Master and Margarita certainly persuades readers who are willing and able to suspend their disbelief that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in conventional philosophies - but the suspension of disbelief requires some effort. It is not surprising that no publishers could be found in the old Soviet Union who were willing to bring this work to the attention of their public.",positive
28,5,"Read it, stick with it if you struggle with where itÃ•s going at any point. It will take you breath away, make you laugh, and cry.I realised half way through that I was in the unbelievably fortunate position of reading something for the first time that would become part of my life afterwards.",positive
29,5,"Just...just read it. Really. There are no words I could give that could accurately express what this book makes the reader feel. Really, it is an anomaly. But all I guess that that is all I can say without getting into the intricacies of the plot and without revealing things that readers should find out on their own through reading this utterly pleasing, mind opening, bizarre and fantastic book. I cannot believe I hadn't read it sooner. An absolute gem of an underrated classic. I have read it twice and I'm sure as anyone else who has enjoyed this book would agree, twice isn't enough. If this book is on your list, buy it. Even if you do not personally like a lot of aspects in regards to the story, reading it cover to cover will never be a regret. One of the all time underrated greats.",positive
30,5,"In Ã’The Master and Margarita,"" Mikhail Bulgakov crafted one of the great novels of the 20th century. ThereÃ•s no easy way to describe this book which touches on the Soviet literary scene in the 1930s, religion, the devil and his court, beautiful women, Pontius Pilate, Jesus, theater, StalinÃ•s regime and a host of other subjects. Add in memorable characters, from a unique take on the devil to his wise cracking cat to a writer in an insane asylum and his lover, and you have a memorable book with insightful takes on love, history, art and religion. Despite the important topics covered in the book, Bulgakov offers enough irony and humor to produce one of the funniest novels I have come across in some time. Most English translations are very solid, perhaps a result of the book being first published in the 1960s, three decades after it was first written. This is easily one of the greatest novels I ever had the pleasure and honor of reading. Highest recommendation.",positive
31,1,"I liked the first chapter, and I thought I was going to like this. But then the two characters are hardly seen for the next 200 pages or so and what we get is an introduction to many characters, flitting from one situation to another in a rapid manner. There are so many characters with no plot of character development. In terms of style of reminded me of a hundred years in solitude (another book I did not enjoy) and there can be no doubt that Garcia was influenced by this. The second half of the book, introducing the master and Margarita was better for me, but the dark fairy tale just wasn't for me. Overall, I found this a frustrating read.",negative
32,2,I don't mind a bit of magical realisim and absurdity but this was too much for me. The talking cat was amusing to start with but the numerous crazy scenes felt meaningless and tedious to read through.,negative
33,5,"I cannot even begin to emphasize how this book is a literary gem. Bulgakov, using his brilliant skills, has managed to take the reader to another era, with bizarre characters through his detailed and rich literary artistry. This book has allowed me to recognize Mikhail Bulgakov as, in my opinion, the best fictional writer of our time. Once again simply said, this is a masterpiece highly recommended to everyone.",positive
34,3,"The product itself is really nice and well made, but the story is quite a different experience. While I enjoyed the first part of the book the second part proved to be quite boring. Even so, the idea is very interesting and it's an important presentation of the communist regime and suprarealism.",neutral
35,4,"I really enjoyed this wacky but incredibly smart book. I was recommended to read it and I'm glad I did,never read a book quite like it. Its creepy yet with moments of humor. A underrated masterpiece.",positive
36,4,"The translation could be better. It was vague in some places. I definitely recommend this book to everyone. Now, I need to read more about this book to digest it better.",positive
37,5,I'm not sure how I've managed to miss this surreal satirical masterpiece until now - but many thanks to Nick from the Station book group for choosing it. How did he get books and plays like this past Pravda and the other apparatus of state censorship? It's interesting to contrast Bulgakov's and Shostakovich's experiences of struggling to survive and work under Stalin.,positive
38,5,"I liked the book very much, I am a great fan of Russian literature, the characters are rich and lush but after reading half way the story is not clever or imaginative but completely bonkers!",positive
39,5,Love this book .One of my all time favourites and always on my bookshelf,positive
40,5,"An extraordinary read. I was skeptical at first, but as I continued to read I found myself mesmerized. Bulgakov is a storyteller in the mold of Gabriel Garcia Marquez. He blends wit and humor with a deep exploration of artistic, philosophical, and historical themes. This is truly a one-of-a-kind novel.",positive
41,4,"Magnificent in scale and very creative. The writing is excellent, but the plot is a bit confused.",positive
42,4,Just wonderfully mental! I'm sure there is lots of analysis in other reviews that are far more eloquent than I could hope to be but this book was just fabulously weird.,positive
43,5,"Any lover of Russian literature must read this book. I was entranced from beginning to end. At one moment seemingly factual and then another, utterly confusing and disturbing. Meet Christ and the devil in one book.",positive
44,5,"Brilliant... if you like Alice in wonderland, and dark comedy. Clever, funny, and unique. Penelope Lively said she couldn't finish it - I could hardly put it down.",positive
45,5,"This is a brilliant book. It is funny, sad, intelligent, ultimately uplifting and humane, and has a lot to say about both Stalin's and Putin's Russia. If you are thinking of reading this, just do it.",positive
46,1,This book is tedious boring and incoherent. A story without purpose reason narrative or interest. Avoids at all costs. It has wasted my time.,negative
47,3,I read this book on the recommendtion of my brother who was very impressed with it. I don't think I quite got the plot!.Sometime in the future I will reread it. I hope things might become clearer to me then.,neutral
48,1,"My Russian husband bought this book for me because he had researched and decided this was the best translation. While this may be the case (I don't know about that), the typos in this book are ridiculous! It is literally hard to get beyond the first chapter because of them. Excerpt complete with typos as seen in the book: ""As to his teeth, he haid platinum crowns on his left side and gold ones on his tight. [...] Right eye black, left ieye for some reason green."" I admit that I am particularly sensitive to this kind of thing, and I understand one or two errors getting by an editor, but this book is riddled with them and it makes it difficult to read, at least for me since every typo is like a hiccup in the flow of a sentence.",negative
49,5,The greatest novel written in the 20th Century.,positive
50,5,This is one of the most beautiful books I have read in a long time. The phrases used at different times just caught me offguard in the beauty of their meaning. It was truly an experience and I know the author feels deeply about things and felt a kinship to her. I am going to read more books of this very talented writer. Thank you!,positive
51,4,Nice quick read. No surprises. If you like Adichie's writing this one meets expectations.,positive
52,5,Raw Mind blowing The writing style is flawless and the display of raw emotions is justâ€¦,positive
53,4,The emotions & easy language & style were engaging-also liked the way the characters were developed- wish it were longer,positive
54,4,"The book is really nice and deep. The character development is also good but the story is so dense, it would have been better if it was stretched a little longer. Good short story but leaves a little unsatisfied feeling. Look forward to more works of the author.",positive
55,5,"Though the overall story is beautiful and how you can feel everything with the author, there are a few lines that you want to read repeatedly for they are so true and beautiful.",positive
56,3,Okayish I didn't get what the author was trying to convey with this short story. Felt it was incomplete or this was how it was meant to be..blah,neutral
57,5,"Artful Sensitive, human and raw. It's a short read, but I couldn't put it down anyway. I",positive
58,5,"Although this book was just 34 pages long, it had a deep impact on my mind",positive
59,4,"The book brings up a very uncomfortable feeling. It ends with no closure. No sort of end. It just stops. Its very well written but if you're like me and prefer an ending whether happy or sad, then this book may disappoint.",positive
60,3,The author did not really justify the story. It was a strange narration. Lots of loopholes in the the plot.,neutral
61,4,Author's words make the reader travel through a rollercoaster of emotions. Emotions subtly portrayed but soundly felt. Words can't say some things that are better not said.,positive
62,5,"Brilliantly written! Heart-touchingly good. A must read for everyone. Even though your life is different from that of the protagonist, you can definitely relate to it in some way or the other.",positive

65,5,"Beautifully evocative, and crisply told.",positive
66,5,"such a joy to read, wish it was longer.",positive
67,5,"This book was AMAZING!!! I love her command of english. Complex but easy enough to read and not burdened by unnecessary grammar. This book made me want to go dig up all my old Chimamda books and re-read them. It was that good. She has such a way with words that draw you completely into the story. My only complaint was that is was too short. Chimamanda, we want more.",positive
68,4,"This was a solid, quick read about a woman by the name of Zikora going through her first birthing experience as a mother. Quick read with good details without being horribly gory.",positive
69,3,"I donâ€™t usually read short stories, but was not expecting it to be just left in limbo. I felt that the end was just cut off, not that I was expecting everything to be resolved, but it just felt unfinished.",neutral
70,1,Very disappointing with no substance. In sharp contrast with her last novel which I loved.,negative
71,1,A huge disappointment,negative

73,5,"This story touched me in a profound way. This amazing writer leaves us wanting more while accomplishing a Goldilocks level of ""just right"". Thank you. Absolutely beautiful.",positive
74,5,I understand that this was a short story but it could have easily been a novel. Some of the language was a little blunt for my taste but overall it was beautifully written. Very engrossing. A good character study.,positive
75,3,I had read half of the book. The writing & language of the book is easy & intersting. The page quality of book which I had purchased is not that good. Seems like that the saller had a got photocopy of original book and the pages r like the rough copy pages.,neutral
76,5,Good read,positive
77,5,I loved the book in its simple narrative to explain the deepest meaning of Meaning,positive
78,5,This book Iâ€™ve read during a bad phase of my life must read,positive
79,5,A heart touching book.How the author maintained his courage and mental balance in extreme adverse situations in life.A must read book to learn Positivity in Life.,positive
80,5,"Man's Search for Meaning written by Viktor Frankl recounts his experiences as a prisoner in Nazi concentration camps during World War 2. This book is an inspiration to anyone who is facing a Quarter-life or Midlife crisis. Once you read the book,you will feel grateful to everything you have in your life and will try to make it even more worth living. It gives motivation to avoid making a wrong choice, by thinking about the plausible consequences of what we are about to do. Many snippets of wisdom in this short volume!",positive
81,2,"Printing and pages are of bad quality, printing will erase in few days",negative
82,5,"This book is my teacher,motivator, inspiration and soo much more. Must go for this, you can skip the psychological preaching parts of the writer, but cover the full story. It will show and prove you that a human being is capable of bearing,sustaining and coping up of any adverse to worst circumstances of life. After reading this you will feel that your life problems are just so small and they can't stop you from achieving your results, because you are too strong to handle them.",positive
83,5,A pure masterclass. A book everyone on earth should read. Brilliant and just blown away. For sure will make a human much more humble after reading it.,positive
84,5,Breathtaking...an unbelievable story of survival,positive
85,3,"Average read - I bought this book after reading a lot of very positive reviews. But for me it turned out to be not so great read. While the part the author covers during his stay in concentration camp is captivating and gives you the sense of what it takes for a man to survive, the second part of the book is all about logotherapy. This is the part for someone looking for understanding on various psychological therapies. I am not the one looking for it and totally skipped it. So if someone is looking for a light reading material that covers real life stories throughout interspersed with life lessons, this may not be the book for you.",neutral
86,3,Overhyped book. Purchased after reading reviews. Personally felt thet the the whole book can be explained in one paragraph also.... meaning of life...,neutral
87,5,This is a great book to make you understand that to leave a happy life always find a reason of achievements in your sufferings instead blaming your luck or anybody else.,positive
88,5,It is a really nice book you are going to love it,positive
89,3,"I have heard a lot about this book, I might have expected a lot or may be I have failed to recognise what others have seen or got from this book, given the circumstances how the author has survived is truly commendable but from books perspective little Disappointed..the print of letters is also too small, go for other publisher",neutral
90,5,Amazing book if you are feeling lost in life and shows the perspective of Holocaust survivors but how to deal with life.,positive
91,5,Awesome read. I makes us understand that being mentally strong is equally or more important that physical strength .,positive
92,5,Amazing book. It truly Opens your eyes.,positive
93,3,"This book is not a good read if you are beginning reading. Its too deep for starting, every line in this book will contain a meaning, and it might make you lose interest because of the tough vocabulary it has at times, but overall a good read and learning if you already are a reader.",neutral
94,5,An amazing book about how the mind can be influenced to make the best out of all situations. Part#1 describes how the author and his mates survived the concentration camps in Auschwitz.,positive
95,3,As always book was deliverd in two days .However somewhat dissapointed by the quality of the book.,neutral
96,4,First half if the book is a drag but the second half delivers a powerful message where he expands upon his psychiatric concept of logotherapy. Language could have been simpler.,positive
97,3,"Good ideas,but far stretched sometimes. Worth reading at least once. But there's nothing new in his logotherapy,it is unconsciously done by everyone since ages. Should have elaborated his experiences in concentration camp more.",neutral
98,5,One of the best book I ever read... Just fantastically written by the author.,positive
99,5,"One of those books that will change the way you look at Life...It has become so powerful bcoz its been written by someone who's gone through the worst and also by a person who is the best to reflect upon it i.e, a psychiatrist. It is a beautiful coincidence of fate..Must read for every human being on this planet..",positive
100,2,"Sapiens' is a short telling of the entire human history, from pre-anatomically modern humans through the agricultural and scientific revolutions and to the present. Or so it attempts to be. Unfortunately, this enormous task is the book's own undoing. There is no room for any indepth discussions about the various complex issues, and no room to discuss the evidence. The book is filled with assertion after assertion, and virtually nothing to back them up. I looked in the reference section and I was shocked to see how few citations there were. Such a massive subject derserves ten times more citations. If you think you're getting a good scientific description of the facts, don't buy this book. This book is essentially his opinions, and not much else. Any person who has strong knowledge within any of the subjects in the book will quickly realise that Harari is not an expert on much of what he writes about. He does not just make many claims. He makes many wrong claims. And many, many more misleading ones. It's one of those books that are popular with the layman, but not so much with the expert. When he leaves the topic of evolutionary biology, premodern history, and starts talking about modern history the book gets slighter better. Or is that just because I'm not as well-versed in those topics? Do I just not see his errors there, just like a layperson would not see his errors in his account of evolutionary biology, intelligence research, and more? I won't know. The problem is I can't put much trust in him, because there are so many things wrong or misleading stuff elsewhere. And he doesn't provide sufficient evidence.Even in the better parts of the book, it is ultimately somewhat dull. Not much new to learn for me, unfortunately. There are so many books about humans, many of them much better than this. I wouldn't claim that this is the worst book ever, obviously. But to say that it is overhyped is to put it mildly. If you want to read a story, then perhaps you might find it interesting. If you want a factual account that is supported by an honest look at the available evidence, then go somewhere else.",negative
101,1,"If you are a believer, this book is a total waste of time. It is not at all a history of humankind, as it follows the scientific route. Yet to find scientists who can provide something which, when they are dating something, confirms without any shadow of a doubt that it was there at the beginning!",negative
102,1,"If you want to learn about the author's feelings and musings about modern society cloaked in the history of our species, this book is for you. If, however, you, as I did, want to learn something scientific about the progress of our species unspoiled by a political screed, search for something else. Rarely have I felt that I misspent money on a book. In this case, I did. Too bad because it might have been an interesting read. I could go on, but it's not worth more of my time.",negative
103,1,"Of course when you're reading a book, you know the author's views & opinions will be biased, but when you're reading a book, the last thing you want is to be bombarded with strong opinions all the time, subtle hints here and there are good. I mean, you wrote a book about it, so I think people have a pretty good idea on where you stand, but the author smacks it in your face, and that ruined the book, which is a shame because it had the potential to be a great book, don't get me wrong, this was a good book, but not a great one.",negative
104,5,"Very fascinating book. A must read, must have book at every household. After a long time, I have finally found time and completed a book. What next, Yes.. Homo Deus.",positive

111,5,This book is a must read for all who are intrigued by the remarkable success of homosapiens. Truly enlightening for the average reader and a must read for those who think of themselves as intellectuals.,positive
112,3,"This could have been a consistently engaging read because it's written in clear, simple language and certainly contends with grand ideas but the gaps in data and analyses left my curiosity stranded and re-purposed to poking holes in the arguments for the most part instead of propelling it.",neutral
113,4,It's not just a history book but also a work of philosophy. I am not giving 5 stars because I believe the author could have done better with respect to Indian history and society but still it's an exemplary work,positive

120,4,"Simply one of the best books I have ever read, going down on my all time favourites and wouldnâ€™t mind reading it again",positive
121,5,The author is somewhat biased and some of the theories discussed are subject to verification. But an excellent literary piece of work.,positive
122,5,"Well written. The best part is how the author has blended the political history of the species with its biological, scientific and economic advances. Most fascinating of all how the author has shown that our ability to believe and execute based on narratives of collective imagination sets us apart from our less imaginative ancestors. System of money, companies, capitalism, law, nations, communism and even religion are nothing but theories that we collectively believe in.",positive
123,5,A beautiful rollercoaster of anthropology. Marvelous presentation. The ethical thinking of the author is well depicted from the very fist to last word. A better work to understand our origin and existence.,positive
